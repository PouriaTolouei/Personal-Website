			<h2>City Sights iOS App</h2>
			<p>
				For this project, I learned Swift and SwiftUI over the break I had before starting university. I followed an online iOS development course and
				I created a city sights app that shows the user a list of popular restaurants and sights near their location and allows them to get directions. 
				This app pulls data from the Yelp API using the user's location to show a list of popular restaurants and sights. The user can see the name, 
				review, and the distance away for each restaurant/sight in the initial list view. However, they can also tap on each item to view further details such
				as address, operation status, description, phone number, number of reviews, and website.

			<h2>What I Learned</h2>
			<p>
				This project taught me a new programming language, Swift, and how to design an app in Xcode. However, more importantly, I learned how an app
				is generally structured and which processes it goes through to become a final product, such as going from a template in Figma to an actual app in 
				Xcode. It took a lot of self-motivation to learn and build this app without anyone forcing me, so overall it taught me how to be an independent learner.

			<h2>Game of Hearts in Java</h2>
			<p>
				This project was the group course cumulating task for my grade 12 computer science course. We had to create a game in Java (text-based) in teams of 2 
				people. So we picked the card game called "Game of Hearts". In this game, cards of Heart are worth 1 point and the queen of spade is worth 13 points. The objective
				of the game is to get as few points as possible while passing around three of your cards around by each round (the direction changes depending on the number of players and the round number). 
				The game ends when at least one player passes a point threshold. There are also additional rules in the game that I won't go into much detail about such as "Heart is broken" and "Shot the moon",
				but these help to make the game more balanced and give a chance of comeback to players if certain cards are collected all at once.

			<h2>What I Learned</h2>
			<p>
				This project allowed me to put together everything that I learned about programming in Java such as; classes, functions, 
				arrays, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and code efficiency. Alongside this, I also got to practice documenting my coding progress
				using UML diagrams. On this note, my partner and I decided to learn Git and GitHub to further document our progress and also work on our shared
				code files remotely. The most valuable experience that I had from this was realizing how working in a group can increase creativity and also split
				a massive load into more manageable pieces for each person to work on. So, it made me appreciate the value of teamwork.

			<h2>Forseen Fake Company Website</h2>
			<p>
				This project was the final assignment for my grade 10 computer science course. I needed to create a website for an imaginary business which also included 
				interactive python scripts to help show off the product or service. I chose to create a company that uses artificial intelligence, machine learning
				, and computer vision to automate surveillance in schools for tasks such as school security and monitoring checkouts in the library. Also, I included a future service for the company
				which is the use of cognitive computing to automate administrative communications.

			<h2>What I Learned</h2>
			<p>
				This project and this course was the reason why I decided to enter the field of computer science. It was my first hands-on experience with coding and it was
				like nothing else that I had done before. While it made me realize how much I enjoy programming, it made me realize and appreciate all the hard work that goes 
				into applications and websites that I use daily. Furthermore, the process of coming up with my business idea made me learn so much about artificial intelligence
				and machine learning as concepts. So altogether, this project inspired me to find out more about this field.
