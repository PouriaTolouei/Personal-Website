					Valorant was the main game that my friend and I played during the weekends in Malaysia.
					It quickly became my favorite first-person shooter game as it incorporates special abilities for each character,
					which adds a nice twist to the game. It's quite a unique game in my opinion.

					Rocket League is a game that I came upon by accident when I was looking for a cool racing game. It's a blend of soccer and racing, so I was skeptical at first.
					However, after realizing that I can do cool aerial stunts to score goals, it definitely won over my heart. Overall, it's quite an innovative mix.

					Minecraft is a game that all of my friends played back in middle school. We used to create towns to live in for months.
					We would even create scenarios and stories to replicate real life. It's one of those games that's a world in itself 
					and possibilities are endless. It's truly a classic.

					GTA 5 is the first game that I played on my console. At the time, it blew me away with its realistic graphics. Not
					only that, similar to Minecraft, it is an open-world game, it's impossible to get tired of. Another classic
					game in my opinion.

					Need For Speed Underground 2 is the first racing game that I played on pc. The way that this game allowed me to customize my cars was 
					quite detailed and aesthetic. My brother and I would spend hours customizing our cars. This game is definitely one of my core childhood memories.

				<p>
					Insaniquarium is the first pc game that I played. It might not look like it, but it's quite a strategic game. 
					Each specie that you choose to include in each round can play an essential role in your victory. It's one of those
					games that keeps you one the edge of your seat.
